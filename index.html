            <h1>What is <br>web-development</h1>
            <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
                intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page
                of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more
                comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web
                design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and
                network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>

            <p>Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN.
                The Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing
                between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.</p>
